Smart contracts to automate many institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, this Solidity smart contract accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account and will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirement for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
